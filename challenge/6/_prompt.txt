This is the third of three dedicated OSCP Challenge Labs. It is composed of six OSCP+ machines. The intention of this Challenge is to provide a mock-exam experience that closely reflects a similar level of difficulty to that of the actual OSCP+ exam.

The challenge contains three machines that are connected via Active Directory, and another three standalone machines that do not have any dependencies or intranet connections. All of the standalone machines have a local.txt and a proof.txt flag, however the Active Directory set only has a proof.txt on the Domain Controller. While the Challenge Labs have no point values, on the exam the standalone machines would be worth 20 points each for a total of 60 points. The Active Directory set is worth 40 points all together.

To align with the OSCP+ 'Assumed Breach' scenario for the Active Directory portion of the exam, please use the credentials below for initial access: Username: Eric.Wallows Password: EricLikesRunning800

All the intended attack vectors for these machines are taught in the PEN-200 Modules, or are leveraged in the PEN-200 Challenge Labs 1-3. However, the specific requirements to trigger the vulnerabilities may differ from the exact scenarios and techniques demonstrated in the course material. You are expected to be able to take the demonstrated exploitation techniques and modify them for the current environment.

Please feel free to complete this challenge at your own pace. While the OSCP+ exam lasts for 23:45 hours, it is designed so that the machines can be successfully attacked in much less time. While each student is different, we highly recommend that you plan to spend a significant amount of time resting, eating, hydrating, and sleeping during your exam. Thus, we explicitly do not recommend that you attempt to work on this Challenge Lab for 24 hours straight.

We recommend that you begin with a network scan on all the provided IP addresses, and then enumerate each machine based on the results. When you are finished with the Challenge, we suggest that you create a mock-exam report for your own records, according to the advice provided in the Report Writing for Penetration Testers Module.
