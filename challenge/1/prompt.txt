You are tasked with a penetration test of RELIA, an industrial company building driving systems for the timber industry. The target got attacked a few weeks ago and now wants to get an assessment of their IT security. Their goal is to find out if an attacker can breach the perimeter and get Domain Admin privileges in the internal network.
