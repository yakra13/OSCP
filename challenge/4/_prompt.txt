This is the first of three dedicated OSCP Challenge Labs. It is composed of six OSCP+ machines. 
The intention of this Challenge is to provide a mock-exam experience that closely reflects a 
similar level of difficulty to that of the actual OSCP+ exam.

The challenge contains three machines that are connected via Active Directory, and another three standalone 
machines that do not have any dependencies or intranet connections. All of the standalone machines have a 
local.txt and a proof.txt flag, however the Active Directory set only has a proof.txt on the Domain Controller. 
While the Challenge Labs have no point values, on the exam the standalone machines would be worth 20 points each 
for a total of 60 points. The Active Directory set is worth 40 points all together.

To align with the OSCP+ 'Assumed Breach' scenario for the Active Directory portion of the exam, please use the 
credentials below for initial access: Username: Eric.Wallows Password: EricLikesRunning800

All the intended attack vectors for these machines are taught in the PEN-200 Modules, or are leveraged in the 
PEN-200 Challenge Labs 1-3. However, the specific requirements to trigger the vulnerabilities may differ from the 
exact scenarios and techniques demonstrated in the course material. You are expected to be able to take the 
demonstrated exploitation techniques and modify them for the current environment.

Please feel free to complete this challenge at your own pace. While the OSCP+ exam lasts for 23:45 hours, 
it is designed so that the machines can be successfully attacked in much less time. While each student is different, 
we highly recommend that you plan to spend a significant amount of time resting, eating, hydrating, and 
sleeping during your exam. Thus, we explicitly do not recommend that you attempt to work on this Challenge Lab for 24 hours straight.

We recommend that you begin with a network scan on all the provided IP addresses, and then enumerate each machine based on 
the results. When you are finished with the Challenge, we suggest that you create a mock-exam report for your own records, 
according to the advice provided in the Report Writing for Penetration Testers Module.




OSCP-A  login using eric.wallows with ssh , do PE, and get celia.almeda hash and use in evil-winrm on MS02 , in ms02 found SAM , SYSTEM , crack then get get tom_admin hash , use tom_admin hash in dc01 and get proof.txt  it is intended?

In OSCP A, so after finding the SAM and SYSTEM in window.old and dumping the creds,,,,, what to do?

Tried extracting the hashes with impacket?

yep
[10:51 AM]
got a list of users and hashes not sure what to do next
[10:52 AM]
and where is DC located? i mean in which network its not there in 192. and 10

Have you tried passing the hashes? 
The DC will be on an internal network

to dc ip?

Right, but you may have to setup a pivot accordingly to reach the target

 In fact, you should be able to authenticate with the hash. Have you tried authenticating with it on other protocols such as WinRM?

For OSCPA. I have completed the set by use of SAM/SYSTEM. Is there a different route to get admin on MS02 and DC01? It just seems to easy a route to own the challenge.
