Please note that this challenge is significantly more difficult than Challenges 1 & 2. It requires a substantial amount of pivoting, tunneling,
looking for information on multiple targets and paying close attention to post-exploitation. It is beyond the scope of the OSCP exam. 
If preparing for the exam is your main objective, you may wish to work through Challenges 4, 5 & 6 before returning to this one. Good luck!

Skylark Industries is an aerospace multinational corporation that performs research & development on cutting-edge aviation technologies. 
One of their major branch office has been recently targeted by an Advanced Threat Actor (APT) ransomware attack.
 For this reason, the company CISO is now urging to further shield Skylark Industries' attack surface. 
 We have so been tasked to conduct a preemptive penetration test towards their HQ infrastructure and find any vulnerability that could potentially jeopardize the company's trade secrets.

The organization topology diagram is shown below and the public subnet network resides in the 192.168.xx.0/24 range,
where the xx of the third octet can be found under the IP ADDRESS field in the control panel.
