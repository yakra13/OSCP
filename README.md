# Static Content Repository

This repository holds static content.

While it only hold images for now, later it will hold PDFs and other digital assets.

Git probably isn't the best for this, but we need to have some form of version control on these assets later. 

## How to use

To use the content in this repository, simply clone or download the repository and access the files as needed. If you have access to the S3 bucket and would like to upload the content to the bucket, you can use the provided script:

./scripts/upload-to-s3.sh

This script will upload all the files in the repository to the specified S3 bucket.
